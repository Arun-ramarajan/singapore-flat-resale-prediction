This project aims to develop and deploy a machine learning model that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The model will use historical data of resale 
flat transactions as the input, and output the estimated resale value of a flat. The model will be integrated into a user-friendly web application that can assist 
both potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions about the resale market.

Skill learnt in this project:

1. Data Wrangling: Collecting and preprocessing data for machine learning.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and relationships.
3. Model Building: Training and evaluating regression models.
4. Model Deployment: Creating an interactive web application for real-time predictions using streamlit.


Requirements, the following libraries to be installed:

1. matplotlib
2. seaborn
3. Pandas
4. Scikit-learn
5. Streamlit
6. plotly
7. scipy
8. numpy
9. Pickle
